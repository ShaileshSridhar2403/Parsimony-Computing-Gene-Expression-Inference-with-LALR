## Dataset

The dataset used belong to the Gene Expression Omnibus and is quite large.If you would like access to the preprocessed data, please send a mail to shailesh.sridhar@gmail.com.

After downloading, exectute parsimoniousDataGeneration.py to split the data into random subsamples as described in the paper.

## Execution instructions

The main code provided in the repo is for running with the entire dataset and not the subsamples, but this modification can be made easily.

Use the command

python D-Gex_colab.py
